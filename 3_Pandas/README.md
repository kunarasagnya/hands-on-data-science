# Pandas Practice

This folder contains my practice notebooks related to Pandas.  
I worked on understanding how DataFrames and Series work and how to clean, filter, and analyze data. Most notebooks include simple examples where I try different Pandas functions to get comfortable with real datasets.

Things I practiced:
- Creating and exploring DataFrames
- Selecting rows and columns
- Handling missing values
- Cleaning and preprocessing data
- GroupBy and aggregation
- Merging and joining datasets
- Sorting and filtering data

These exercises helped me understand how to handle data properly before applying any ML model.
