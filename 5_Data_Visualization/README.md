# Data Visualization Practice

This folder includes my practice using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
I learned how to make different types of charts and how to customize them. Most of the notebooks include simple visualizations to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

Visuals I practiced:
- Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots
- Histograms and distribution plots
- Boxplots, countplots, pairplots
- Heatmaps and correlation charts
- Customizing titles, colors, labels, and themes

Doing these visualizations helped me understand data better and improved my EDA skills.
