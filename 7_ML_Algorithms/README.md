# Machine Learning Algorithms Practice

This folder contains notebooks where I practiced different ML algorithms using sklearn.  
Each notebook focuses on one algorithm and includes data loading, preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation. I mostly tried small datasets to understand how the algorithms behave.

Algorithms I practiced:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM
- Clustering (like KMeans)
- Basic model evaluation metrics

These notebooks helped me understand how ML models work and how to implement them step by step.
