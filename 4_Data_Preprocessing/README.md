# Data Preprocessing Practice

This folder contains my notebooks related to data preprocessing.  
I practiced different ways to handle missing values, treat outliers, and prepare data for machine learning. These notebooks include simple examples where I tried different techniques and observed how they change the dataset.

## Topics I Worked On:
- Identifying missing values  
- Filling or dropping missing data  
- Simple and advanced imputing  
- Handling duplicates  
- Treating outliers  
- Scaling and transforming data  
- General preprocessing steps  

This practice helped me understand the importance of clean, well-prepared data in any real-world project.
