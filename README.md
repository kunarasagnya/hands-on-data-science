# Data Science Fundamentals – Practice Notebooks

This repository contains my complete practice work for learning **Data Science and Machine Learning** using Python.  
I organized all my notebooks into clear sections so anyone can easily follow my learning path.

These notebooks cover the core skills required for data analysis, ML model building, and real-world problem solving.

## Folder Overview

### **01_NumPy**
Practice with NumPy arrays, indexing, reshaping, vectorized operations, and numerical computations.

### **02_Pandas**
Working with DataFrames, filtering, merging, grouping, cleaning, and handling real datasets.

### **03_Data_Preprocessing**
Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, scaling, transformations, and preparing data for ML.

### **04_Data_Visualization**
Creating charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn, understanding trends, patterns, and correlations through visual analysis.

### **05_Statistics_for_ML**
Basic statistics such as mean, variance, correlation, regression intuition, and concepts used in ML.

### **06_ML_Algorithms**
Hands-on practice with Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Clustering.

### **07_Projects**
Small end-to-end projects like Amazon Sales Dashboard and Car Price Prediction.
