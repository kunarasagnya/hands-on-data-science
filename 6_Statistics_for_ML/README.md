# Statistics for Machine Learning

This folder has notebooks where I practiced basic statistics used in ML.  
I learned how to calculate summary statistics and how relationships between variables work. These topics helped me build intuition for machine learning algorithms.

Topics I practiced:
- Mean, median, mode
- Variance and standard deviation
- Correlation and covariance
- Simple regression concepts
- Understanding relationships between variables

These basic statistics helped me understand how to interpret data and evaluate ML models.
