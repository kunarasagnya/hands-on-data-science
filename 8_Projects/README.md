# Mini Data Science Projects

This folder contains small end-to-end projects I practiced.  
Each project includes cleaning the dataset, analyzing it, visualizing it, and building a simple ML model when needed.

Projects included:
- Amazon Sales Dashboard
- Car Price Prediction
- (More projects will be added as I learn)

These projects gave me hands-on experience and showed how all the concepts come together in real problems.
