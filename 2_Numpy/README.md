# NumPy Practice

This folder has my practice work using NumPy.  
I learned how to create and work with arrays, do mathematical operations, reshape data, and perform basic calculations. Most of the notebook is just me exploring different NumPy functions and understanding how arrays work.

Topics I practiced:
- Creating 1D, 2D arrays
- Indexing and slicing
- Adding, subtracting, multiplying arrays
- Broadcasting
- Reshaping and flattening
- Stacking and splitting arrays
- Basic stats like mean, min, max
- Matrix operations

This practice helped me improve my basics for data science and machine learning.
